The elasticsearch extract names plugin does a Named-entity recognition of names of persons. It scans all fields of the document and stores all retrieved names in the field 'extracted_names'

1)
To execute the name extraction on a document call it like so:

curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/eheritage/heritage_place/QLD-600073/_extractnames'

2)
To build to plugin execute maven:

mvn clean package

The build should produce the file target/releases/extractnames-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip 

3)
To install the plugin into elasticsearch use the plugin script that comes with elasticsearch (bin folder)

./plugin -u file:///.../extractnames-plugin/target/releases/extractnames-plugin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip --install extract-names-plugin
